HOW TO SETUP THE IDE

Currently we use
    Eclipse 3.7.2 (Indigo)
    Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin 5.5.0
as IDE. All other settings (code format, warnings, etc.) are stored with the project.


HOW TO SETUP THE PROJECT

Run
    mvn install
to retrieve all needed libraries (and their sources if available).
