HOW TO SETUP THE IDE
====================
Currently we use
    Eclipse 2020-03 (4.15.0)
    Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin 8.29.0 (based on Checkstyle 8.29)
as IDE. All other settings (code format, warnings, etc.) are stored with the project.


HOW TO SETUP THE PROJECT
========================
Run
    ant resolve-dependencies
to retrieve all needed libraries (and their sources if available) into the folder /lib (and /lib_src).

!IMPORTANT! NEVER check in the folders /build and /deploy or the content of the folders /lib and /lib_src.


HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT
========================
Just run
    ant package
and everything will be done and placed into the folder /deploy.


HOW TO ADD LIBRARIES
====================
Just add the needed libraries as new dependencies to the file
    ivy.xml
(see IVY documentation for more details) and run
    ant resolve-dependencies
to retrieve the new libraries into the folder /lib. After that you can just add them to the classpath.
