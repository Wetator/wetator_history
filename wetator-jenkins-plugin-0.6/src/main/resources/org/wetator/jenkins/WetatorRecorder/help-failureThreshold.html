<div>
If the number of failing Wetator tests is greater than this threshold then the build is marked as failure.
I.e., a value of 0 means that the build status is changed if there is at least one failing Wetator test.
Leave this field empty if the state of the build should not be set to failure depending on the number of failing Wetator tests.
(default: never)
